        <h1 class="text-centered article-title">So, why a website?</h2>
          <p class="text-centered article-subtitle">April, 2017</p>
          <p class="indented">
            Because it's super trendy and cool to have your own website these days? Probably some of that. But the main reason is because I have recently discovered the joys of front-end web development. In December of 2016, I graduated with a
            marketing degree at Georgia Tech's Scheller College of Business, and after taking some digital-centric marketing courses that dealt with SEO, user experience, and analytics, I became interested in knowing more about this "HTML, CSS, and
            Javascript" stuff. In only a few months I feel like I've learned a lot, but I know there is much more to learn (thanks to the massive amount of articles that overwhelm me with talk about this and that new technology). But now at least I
            can say that I am officially motivated to dig deeper into the world of web-development and programming.
          </p>

          <p class="indented">
            <strong>This website is the result of a desire to build a website from scratch</strong> without the use of any CSS or JS libraries. Not because I don't like those things or anything. They are super efficient, impressive, and sweet
            actually. Truthfully, I just want to make sure that I have the best understanding possible of what is happening in the browser before I go on and grasp greater concepts. So far in my code-learning journey, I have found
            it helpful to find solutions in the most basic way possible, even if it isn't the most efficient way of doing so at first. As I continue learning, I can then go back and analyze my old work and therefore learn from my mistakes (or that's
            the plan at least). So here I am; I'm trying.
          </p>

          <p class="indented">
            I would also say that this website was built to serve as a tool to share some of my favorite artforms, which recently consist mostly of <a href="music.html">music</a> and <a href="visuals.html">vector graphics &
              photography</a>, <a href="realbread.html"><strong>real sourdough bread</strong></a>, all of which can now, thanks to this website, be contained within this minimalistic aesthetic that I find to be
            pleasing to the eye. For now I'll only be showcasing a few things, but perhaps I can expand in the future. 
            
            (2021 update - I also started a lil'  <a href="blog.html"><strong>blog</strong></a>, which will serve mostly as a public journal, probably rambly theological thoughts).

          <p class="indented">
            And finally, this website exists simply because it's been fun to create.
