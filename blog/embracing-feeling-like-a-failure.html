              I'm not so much referring to "failure" in a fundamental way, i.e.
              being a sinner who has fallen short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). To embrace that reality through repentance and faith and receive the forgivenes and healing from Christ is indeed a beautiful thing. It's a failure I want to embrace every day.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
              But the failure I'm talking about is a bit different. It's the kind that needs no prompt, but wistfully flows out of the heart and into the air as the mere phrase, "I feel like a failure."
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
              I've been trying to wrap my head around this feeling. Where does
              it come from? Why can it feel so debilitating? What does it have
              to say about the ways we view ourselves? The ways we view God?
            </p>


            <p class="blog-post">
              "I just turned 30/40/50, what am I doing with my life?"
              <br>"I wish I got a degree in college"
              <br>"I wish I <em>hadn't</em>   gone to college."
              <br> "I thought I would've met such-and-such goal by now."
              <br> "I thought I would've achieved such-and-such accolade by now."
              <br>"I'd love to be married."
              <br>"Maybe I should've stayed single."

              <br>"I could never run a business."

              <p class="blog-post">
               These are only a handful of the types of thoughts we all deal with. They range from inocuous to deathly despairing. But they all cause us to take on the identity of failure. They're invasive. Sometimes they're even violent. And they all seem to revolve around the theme of <em>how we fit into society</em> or <em>how we contribute to the world</em> or <em>how we are perceived by our social circles</em>. They can weigh on us heavily, but I know we don't have to be enslaved to these feelings. There is life in God's Word.
              </p>
  

            <p class="blog-post">
              I can't help but go to Romans 12 where verse three says:
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post bible-verse">
              3 For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to
              think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think
              with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that
              God has assigned.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
              Right before this verse is the command for Christians to offer
              themselves as living sacrifices and to not be conformed to the
              world, but be transformed by the renewing of their minds. So then,
              it seems like this action of "viewing oneself with sober judgment"
              is one the first vital steps in that process of mind-renewal.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
              But, "feeling like a failure" isn't "thinking too highly of
              oneself" <br />
              ... <br />
              right?
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
              It's tempting to think that way. It's tempting to read verse three
              and think,
              <em>I don't really struggle with that</em>, and then go on with my
              day cycling through painfully self-deprecating thoughts, assuring
              myself I am an example of humility.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
              For me, the key to overcoming this "feeling like a failure" was to embrace my
              failure. The verse doesn't <em>only</em> say "don't think too
              highly" and end there. It tells us a way to think, and that's with
              <strong>sober-judgment</strong>. Not too high, but also, not too
              low. <strong>According to the measure of faith that
                God has assigned</strong>.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
              What's the opposite of sober? Well, I guess it's to be drunk.
              Drunk judgment. My self-deprecating thoughts are not humility, but
              an intoxication with myself--a more covert manifestation of pride.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
              We need to believe that God gives good gifts generously (James 1:5, 17). But also, in His wisdom, to various degrees to different people (Matthew 25:14-30; 1 Peter 4:10). This can be a hard thing to hear. Some of us might even go as far to say it's unfair. And when we feel this way, I think we are in a perfect place to learn to embrace.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
              So what does the embracing part look like? I think it looks like 1 Corinthians 1:26-31:
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post bible-verse">
              26 For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise
              according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many
              were of noble birth. 27 But God chose what is foolish in the world
              to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame
              the strong; 28 God chose what is low and despised in the world,
              even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, 29
              so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. 30 And
              because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom
              from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption, 31 so
              that, as it is written, “Let the one who boasts, boast in the
              Lord.”
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
             Looking at this passage side-by-side with Romans 12:3 I notice two "according to" phrases. We can either view ourselves <em>according to wordly standards</em> (drunk) or <em>according to the measure of faith God has assigned</em> (sober).
            </p>

         <p class="blog-post">
              So what should this reality do for us when we are struggling? It should launch us into freedom! Mind renewal is possible for all those who are indwelled by the Holy Spirit. But, perhaps, in the same way an alcoholic might need a large period of time, counseling, and accountability in order to overcome their addiction, likewise, we need the same things in order to overcome our inclination to binge on intoxicating, self-deprecating, thoughts.
            </p>

          <p class="blog-post">
                So, "feeling like a failure" no longer has to be burdensome. It can be the very thing that points to our truest identity, which is: in Christ. <em>He</em> is our wisdom. <em>He</em> is our righteousness. <em>He</em> is our sanctification. <em>He</em> is our redemption. To be in Christ is to be invincible. It's the best thing in the world.
              </p>

          <p class="blog-post">This surely makes those other things we worry about appear so small. It's only then that I think we can truly begin to appreciate and give thanks for the ways we have been <em>uniquely</em> gifted. Because now, we aren't so concerned about the ways we want to boast in ourselves or impress others. We go from being flatterers to edifiers.  </p>
                
          <p class="blog-post">
                If I fail, I'm in Christ. 
                <br> If I succeed, I'm in Christ.
              </p>
                
          <p class="blog-post">
                Regardless, my gifts can be developed and cultivated under the umbrella of God's provision and grace for His glory and my good and the good of my neighbor.
               </p>

               <p class="blog-post">
                 The writer of Hebrews says something very interesting that I think is relevant to this topic, and it strikes me as both a comfort and a warning.
               </p>

               <p class="blog-post bible-verse">
                9 Though we speak in this way, yet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things—things that belong to salvation. 10 For God is not unjust so as to overlook your work and the love that you have shown for his name in serving the saints, as you still do. (Hebrews 6:9-10)
               </p>

               <p class="blog-post">
                 If there is fruit in our lives, if we are drawing near to God daily, if we are developing our God-given gifts and talents, if we are building up the church--God will not overlook it! In my self-deprecation, I might be guilty of calling God unjust, and I don't want to do that.
               </p>
