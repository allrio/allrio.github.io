            <p class="blog-post">
              It’s really hard for me to talk about deeper, meaningful things on the internet, especially on social media. I don’t know what it is exactly, but ever since the age of 18 or so, I decided I wouldn’t do much on social media except share a photo here and there, maybe share a meme or a song I like, but nothing much more than that. I’m mostly thankful I’ve been this way. Overall, I think it’s helped me develop healthy habits. But when it comes to sharing things I actually care about, I find myself filled with intense anxiety. I hear a voice convincing me that no one cares, and often worse things.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
              But when it comes to sharing my thoughts on this album, I think it would be a good practice to get over my initial hesitancy. But I’m only going to do it here, on my website, beyond the noise. I’ll still try to keep it brief, but I’m gonna do it. If you’re here reading this, thank you. Whether you’re here because you loved the album or are curious about it or hated it or felt ambivalent about it, thank you. You’re engaging with it, and that itself is appreciated.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
              I began working on “Full Hearts, Empty Places” in 2017, though I didn’t know it at the time. It started with a tragedy, the death of a friend to suicide. It’s a strange, conflicting feeling to attempt to make art out of terrible things. If you’re an artist you know what I mean. But it was the most natural way I felt it appropriate to respond, to grieve. Our friendship was a budding one, but nonetheless special and unlike any other, and was often centered around the making and appreciation of music, black coffee, and long, lingering nights discussing heavy matters of life and faith.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
              Losing someone to suicide is a unique kind of hell. And for me, this hell was exacerbated by the fact that we were kindred spirits, not only in the good ways, but in the ways we struggled as well, the main one of which goes something like this: believing the lie that a justified existence revolves around fitting into a neatly packaged cultural idea of what "success" looks like. Ideally, those of us who are tempted to give in to this mentality have sober minded friends and family who empathize with us, embolden us, and speak the truth in love to us, helping us differentiate the transient and the eternal. It's not that he didn't have that, but I guess that's what makes it so hard. That's what leaves us with unanswered questions, fights with God, and the need for endurance.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
              And so while this tragedy was very much the catalyst of this project, the main theme touches more on where I found myself the next several months following his death. Struggling to kickstart a career path, I resorted to looking for jobs where I could work with my hands just to feel something. Earlier that year, before my friend's passing, I'd developed an interest in baking. I'll never forget the day I had him try a slice of freshly baked bread for the first time. His eyes widened and he smiled a big smile. In his make-you-belly-laugh kind of way, he ranted on about how all store-bought bread is garbage and terrible and how we need to save the industry. In that moment I imagined the both of us jaded young men starting an artisan bakery together, or something like that. It's a happy memory.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
              So, I became a biscuit-maker for a new brunch spot down the street. But it didn't take very long for me to be filled with shame. Having just graduated from a highly acclaimed university, I felt the piercing judgments (whether actual or assumed) of many of those around me. It was hard to look at people in the eyes. Later on, I'd end up working at a few more bakeries/restaurants. I became known as a bread guy. It felt like it became the only thing I really knew how to do well, and despite the fact that I met great people along the way and learned lots of skills, I found myself becoming resentful. But still to this day, somehow, by some miracle, I can’t get myself to say I regret any of it.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
              It was good and it was bad. My heart was full. Full of hope just as much as pain. I discovered the “quiet place” more than I ever had. I learned a lot in these often-lonely environments. I learned about the cleansing of the conscience, the healing of the soul. Working with flour and water daily, thinking of the Bread of Life, hearing God speak to me in my lowliness, my prayers ascended to God like the steam from the ovens. In these places, I was constantly reminded of the pain that sent my friend over the edge. Every day I wanted to become hardened. I’d abuse myself verbally, saying vicious things. But God would wrestle my words back down to the ground. I became frail. Humbled. I learned that the Lord God is far, far better at being faithful than we are at being unfaithful. These songs try their best to portray that reality.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
              “Full Hearts, Empty Places” 
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
              This is an album of catharsis. I can’t say I wrote it with any one audience in mind. It might sound selfish, but I wrote this album for myself. If you catch me on an angsty day I might say “I don’t give a damn about what anyone thinks of this album.” But of course I don't mean that. What I really mean is, it isn’t meant to be something to be rated or critiqued. It isn’t something to be evaluated and determined to be “professional” or “amateur”. It is simply an honest thing that I made. It's an open journal. I put a lot of my heart into it, whatever that’s worth. And I simply hope it will resonate with some of you. I hope it will stir up your affections to be grateful, to see the value in being lowly. I hope it causes you to see the blessing in feeling small.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
              I hope you are moved by this album, but not from the story only. A component of the process of creating this record that I think can easily go overlooked is the fact that it is as "indie" and "DIY" as it gets. I struggle to share that because I’m scared of it coming off as flex, but I assure you it's not. Collaboration is always better. But I think it adds an important layer to the listening experience to know that not only the instrumentation, but every effect and layer, every choice of experimental production and mixing–the entire recording process–was intentionally crafted by me in my meek "apartment studio” in order to ensure that my feelings were being communicated honestly through sound. You might be wondering if there’s maybe some control freak issues I need to work on, and you might be right. But ultimately, I think it has more to do with the fact that producing and mixing is an artform in and of itself, and I love it. In ways, I resonate with that process more than the songwriting process. It was important to me for you to hear that “place” I was in during that season of my life.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
              But this album feels like the tip of the iceberg to me. It's a great personal accomplishment for sure, but I have a deep desire to keep growing and maturing in my songwriting and overall sound. I want to keep communicating the hope that I have in the most compelling way that I can afford. Feel free to join me along the way.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
              Again, I’m very thankful that anyone would take the time to listen to “Full Hearts, Empty Places” as well as read these thoughts. It’s not easy putting all the time, energy, and resources into an artistic craft for what often seems to be little to no return. But I guess our definition of “return” is all screwed up, isn’t it? If you do feel inclined to support, feel free to <a href="https://allenodell.bandcamp.com/">purchase the album on Bandcamp.</a> You can also stream on Spotify, Apple Music, or whatever other streaming platform you prefer. And tell your friends/enemies about it, too.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-post">
              The album ends with the line “Heal Us, Emmanuel.” Emmanuel (or Immanuel) is the Hebrew name for “with us is God.” And more than anything, I hope you find true healing for the wounds life brings, however large or small, and true forgiveness and cleansing for your consciences, all of which Christ gives generously without reproach. God bless you and keep you and shine upon you.
            </p>
