        <h2 class="text-centered">Lowliness of Mind</h2>
        <p class="indented">
          Lowliness of Mind is a collection of songs I've written over the past few years that hopefully accurately reflect the frequencies of a repentant heart, that is, a heart that mourns over the evils of the world and within, yet continues to cling on to a hope that cannot be shaken.
        </p>

            All of my lyrics are informed by a Christian worldview, hence the description above. That does not, however, mean that these lyrics are going to be filled with cheesy Christian radio type stuff (At least I hope not... I'd hate to contribute to that). The lyrical content in these songs is a direct result of wrestling with difficult questions and feeling the weight of sin in the world and in my own heart...

            The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it? <br> Jeremiah 17:9

        <p class="indented">
            ...and coming to the conclusion that only the humble Savior can heal the pain and suffering we experience as sinners in a sin-stained world.

            Jesus told them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners." <br> Mark 2:17

        <p class="indented">
            Musically, I am inspired by all sorts of genres, and I'd like to say that all those genres make their way into my sound one way  or another. As far as artists and bands that may have had a direct impact on the sound of Lowliness of Mind, I'd think of: My Epic, From Indian Lakes, Jon Foreman (Switchfoot), Mutemath, Sufjan Stevens, Dustin Kensrue (Thrice), Blindside, As Cities Burn, Bon Iver, Citizens & Saints, Kings Kaleidoscope, and several other artists such as these. If you're a fan of any of them, there's a good chance you might enjoy the songs. Honestly, they might just be terrible. I guess we'll find out. Stay tuned.
